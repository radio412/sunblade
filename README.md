# sunblade

This is a quick and working, but unfinished project to show an efficient 4 port display of a single scene within individual controls.

A date/time controller is implemented via moment.js

The sun position then uses the date/time to position the sun in the scene using suncalc.js

Built using Three alpha 0.87
