# sunblade




This is a quick and working, but unfinished project to show an efficient 4 port display of a single scene with individual controls.

A date/time controller is implemented via moment.js

The sun position then uses the date/time to position the sun in the scene using suncalc.js

Built using Three alpha 0.87

If you have a WebGL enabled browser, see it working at https://radio412.github.io/sunblade/index.html

The example uses the latitude and longitude of Sydney. Change this in js/kansas.js
